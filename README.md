<hr>
<p>The course outline is still not "set in stone." I'll be building it in modules so you can have check points if you want to take a break
and come back to it in the future. At this point I'm guessing there will be 30-50 videos.</p>

<p>We'll start by building almost the entire interface and then move onto the back-end.</p>
<p>The back-end will be almost 100% Firebase as that will make it simply for the purposes of this course. </p>
<p>If this were a real production app I would probably use:

<ul>
<li>Firebase for user management and authentication</li>
<li>Amazon Web Services to store images and videos</li>
<li>A server (website) SQL database for saving all other data. Take a look 
<a href='https://github.com/Vheissu/Open-Source-Database-Schemas/blob/master/vheissu-instagram-schema.md' target='_blank'>here</a> for an outline of what 
the database would roughly look like if you did that. (SQLite is probably fine)</li>
</ul>
<p/>

<p>That would require a <b>TON</b> more code. Setting up the server/website alone would probably be another 20 videos or so. So to keep
things simple and condensed I will just use Firebase for everything. After all this is an Android Course, not a web development course.</p>
